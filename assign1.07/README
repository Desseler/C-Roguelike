Source code: parser.cpp, parser.h

Implements parsing of a monster description .txt file and outputs to console.
It uses ifstream and string in C++. The program no longer has normal functionality
of generating a dungeon and starting the game. According to the assignment
specification, it has been changed to parse the text file located at:

$HOME/.rlg327/monster_desc.txt


and output the parsed data to console. The program takes no arguments and can be
compiled with the following command:

make rlg327


Run with:

./rlg327


Clean with:

make clean
