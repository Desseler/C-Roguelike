**Added a tile selector.**
Allows selection of tiles within PC field of view. Tile selector
is activated with input 'r'. Once in selector mode, you can move
around with standard movement keys and leave selector mode by
pressing ESC. There are 5 main functions in selector mode:

'r': Performs a ranged attack on the highlighted monster
'z': Performs a Hadouken on the highlighted monster
'x': Performs an EX Hadouken on the highlighted monster
'c': Performs a Shinku Hadouken on the highlighted monster
'i' & 'I': Inspects the highlighted monster. Shows name, description
and basic stats


**Added ranged combat.**
Used by pressing 'r' in tile selector mode. If a monster is
selected and the PC has equipment in eq_slot_ranged, then ranged combat
is performed and the PC's turn is spent. Else, nothing happens and PC
does not lose turn. Damage is calculated as such:

-Full damage from item in eq_slot_ranged
-No damage added from eq_slot_weapon or eq_slot_offhand
-1/4 damage added from every other equipped item

* Note: The default object_desc.txt does not contain a ranged weapon. An *
* alternate with a ranged weapon has been included                       *


**Added 3 bars of Super Combo Gauge, AKA "Meter", for the PC.**
This is based on the Super Combo Gauge from the Street Fighter series.
Specifically, it is designed like its incarnation in Street Fighter V.
The PC starts with 0 meter and has a max capacity of 300. There are 2
ways to gain meter: give or receive damage. Every time the PC engages
in physical or ranged combat, the amount of damage given or received is
added to the gauge. Only up to 40 meter can be added per combat
engagement. No meter is added during engagements where the PC spends meter.
Meter can be used to perform powerful special Hadoukens.


**Added special ranged move: "Hadouken!".**
Based on the Hadouken from the Street Fighter series. Special ranged attack.
Use by pressing 'z', 'x', or 'c' in tile selector mode. The damage is
calculated from the items in eq_slot_amulet, eq_slot_lhring, and
eq_slot_rhring. Each Hadouken has different properties as follows:

-'z': "Hadouken" Normal damage. Costs 0 meter. Builds meter as normal.
PC shouts "Hadouken!" on use.

-'x': "EX Hadouken" Increased damage. Costs 100 meter (one bar). Does not
build meter. PC shouts "Strike!" on use. If the PC does not have enough
meter, performs a regular Hadouken.

-'c': "Shinku Hadouken" Greatly increase damage. Deals splash damage to
monsters in 2 tile radius. Damage falls off with increasing distance.
Costs 300 meter (3 bars. Meter will be highlited and show "CA" when Shinku
Hadouken is available). Does not build meter. PC shouts "Shinku Hadouken!!!"
on use.


**Implemented PC equipment defence.**
Armor damage scaling uses the knockback calculation algorithm from
Super Smash Bros. Melee. It has been modified heavily to work with
this game's variables and scale properly. The algorithm used can be
