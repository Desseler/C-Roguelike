Coms 327 assignment1.05. User interfaces with ncurses.h
by Trevor Luster

Uses Jeremy's code from assignment1.04.

in pc.c:
   Edited pc_next_pos to take input from user.
   Added n_draw. Main method for drawing dungeon in ncurses. Also draws PC position, current viewed sector of dungeon, and PC kill/avenged count.

in rlg327.c:
   Edited move loop to check for dungeon regeneration variable. If regen == 1, regenerate dungeon by cleaning memory then reinitializing dungeon. Kill/avenged count are saved between regenerations.
